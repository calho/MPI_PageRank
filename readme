pair of programs that calculates page rank with MPI

basic mainly uses send/recv/bcast
main mainly uses scatterv/allgatherv

to run main on single computer
mpirun -np [core #] ./main
to run main on cluster
mpirun -np [core #] -f [hosts file] ./main

to run baisc on single computer
mpirun -np [core #] ./basic
to run basic on cluster
mpirun -np [core #] -f [hosts file] ./basic

to run program 10 times on a certain node size
./copyToCluster.sh 
//This will create data inputs based on size given and then copies it to our destination computers
./mycheck.sh
//this is what will run a program multiple times
//inputs required for it will be if it will be running singularly or on cluster
//other inputs will be program name (main/basic)
//default for rest is fine
